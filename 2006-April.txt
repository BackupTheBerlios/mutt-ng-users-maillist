I have just updated to muttngr797 and I am no longer prompted for my
IMAP password and, as such, logging in is failing.

Would someone have a look to see what the problem might be with this
revision?

Thanks.

Subject: How to mark newsgroup messages as read
Message-ID: <20060421165818.GC11974@itgssi.com>

My muttng configuration gives unread mail messages a different color
than read messages, a feature I like.

I would like to do the same with newsgroup messages but muttng never
seems to mark newsgroup messages as read.  Or at least if it does, my
usual colors don't take effect.  How can I tell muttng to paint unread
newsgroup messages and read messsages differently?

I use muttng-20060417 on Linux.  I run muttng from GNU screen and
establish my telnet session via PuTTY.

Thank you.

Never mind, I see the problem.  I confused "<Esc>i" with "i".  That
might explain it.  :-)

BANK OF AMERICA (ASIA)LTD.
17/F DEVCON HOUSE
979 KING'S ROAD
HONG KONG.
graham_bal96 at yahoo.com.hk
Dear Friend,
I am Mr.Graham R. Baldock, credit officer of Bank of
America (Asia) Ltd, Hong Kong. I am an Australian by
nationality working with the Bank of America Asian
Branch.
I  have an urgent and  very confidential business
proposition for you.
On october 6, 2001, an American Engineer/Consultant
with  the Chinese Solid  Minerals Corporation,
Mr. Mathew Paxton made a (Fixed) Deposit for twelve
calendar months, valued at US$40,500,000.00 (Forty
Million  Five Hundred thousand United State Dollars
only) in my branch.
Upon maturity,I sent a routine  notification to his
forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we
sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his
contract employers, the  Hong Kong Solid Minerals
Corporation that Mr. Mathew Paxton died from a
recurrent heart disease.
On further investigation,I found out that he died
without making  a will, and all attempts to trace his
next of kin was  fruitless.
I therefore made further investigation and discovered
that  Mr. Mathew Paxton did not declare any next of
kin or relations in all his  official documents,
including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.
This sum of US$40,500,000.00 is still lingering in my
Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the
principal sum at the end of each year. No one will
ever come forward to claim it.
According to the Hong Kong Law,under china's foreign
and defense affairs,at the expiration of 5 (five)
years,such funds will revert to the ownership of the
chinese Government for financing military
operations,such as purchasing of arms and ammunitions
for the military.
In order to avert this negative development,i will
like to seek for your permission as a foreigner to
stand as the next of kin to Mr. Mathew Paxton so that
the fruits of this old man's labor will not be use for
financing weapons which will further enhance the
courses of war in the world in general.
The money will be paid into your account for us to
share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and
10% for Expenses Incurred in the course of the
transaction.There is no risk at all as all the
paperwork  for this project will be done by my
attorney and with my position as the credit officer
guarantees the successful execution of this project.
If you are interested,please reply immediately.
Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more
details and that will help you understand the
transaction.
You should observe utmost confidentiality,and rest
assured  that this  project would be most profitable
for both parties because I shall require your
assistance to invest my share in your country.
Awaiting your urgent reply.
Thanks and regards.
Mr.Graham R. Baldock

Subject: Using control keys.
Message-ID: <20060428141659.GA27174@cc543.inse.lucent.com>

I am trying to use control keys to navigate the sidebar. I want control-j to move down an entry, control-k to move up an entry, and
control-o to open the mailbox. I have these keybindings in my .muttngrc file:

bind index ^k sidebar-prev
bind index ^j sidebar-next
bind index ^o sidebar-open

When I type one of these key combinations muttng tells me that the key is not bound. When I look at the help it looks like it is bound.
What am I doing wrong here?

Thanks.

Use "\c" not "^"

Modify your .muttngrc to look like this:

	bind index \Ck sidebar-prev
	bind index \Cj sidebar-next
	bind index \Co sidebar-open

Hope this helps,
