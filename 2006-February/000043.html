<PRE>Hi,

As said, I cannot reproduce this on several systems with compressed and 
uncompressed mbox and maildir.

I had a look at the code now. As far as I can tell, we didn't touch a 
single line so far in this area. Also, the calls are so obvious that I 
just can't imagine mail being marked as new.

That means I'm somewhat stuck.

The only way of getting more detailed information of what's going on 
seems to be to temporarily add some debugging code to see why this 
doesn't work for some users...

Is anybody willing of those affected to help?

   bye, Rocco
