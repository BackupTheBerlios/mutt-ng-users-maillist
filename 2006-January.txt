Yes. As you come up with it now, it looks like the documentation isn't 
good enough: expansion only takes place when doing "plain" assignments. 
Backticks are handled using the system's shell which doesn't know any 
muttng specific variables so it doesn't work. Your config line has the 
same effect as running

   $ echo $FOO | sed ...

from the command-line when $FOO doesn't exist.

That's what I suspected, thanks for confirming it.

Do you see any way to remove the "INBOX." substring from 
"INBOX.mutt-ng-users" with standard muttng configuration language?

Happy new year to all muttng users!

I assume $ which mozilla is 1
try
text/html; /usr/bin/mozilla '%s'; description=HTML Text; \
test=test -n "$DISPLAY";  nametemplate=%s.html

Thanks Elimar.
Was an alternatives problem. /etc/alternatives/x-www-browser pointed
to an old 'mozilla'. (debian/sarge)

Subject: Setting read-only flag via a folder-hook?
Message-ID: <43d104d6.784757f0@vuk.kjorling.com>

Is there any way to set the read-only flag via a folder-hook such that
it applies to the mailbox the folder-hook matches? I tried:

folder-hook 'whatever' 'set read_only'

which sort of works, but it requires me to open the mailbox twice for
the change to take effect. While in theory I could automate that as
well, it seems rather wasteful. Surely there must be a better way, but
how would I do it?

I am using muttng-20051231 (svn-655).

hi

not to annoy you, you've probably heard this a dozen times, but what's
the state of things on the rewrite?
the old releases were promising, so i'm wondering when there'll be a new
version. i understand that there's still a lot to do, but what kind of
time frame were you thinking about for the rewrite? weeks? years?
haven't found anything about it on the wiki or blog.

also, do you have an irc-channel? i didn't find #muttng or #mutt-ng on
freenode or otfc. how about setting one up?

thanks and keep up the good work!

ps, please keep me in cc:, i'm not on the list.

Like in debian, we will release if we finished :)
AK is at "Bundersheer" (army) at the moment, I am very busy 
with university. The only one contributing on a regular 
basis at the moment is rocco. I think you can expect a 
release this year but not in a few months.

We had one in the past but it sucked ;)

I can post to a newsgroup just fine, but I am wondering the best way to
reply.  If I just go an "r" or "g", I end up getting a mail to the users
email address.  The only way I can see is to do another Post with the
same subject and use the followupto field, but there must be a better way (I
don't even know if that would work).  Any ideas?

The appropriate command is called Followup, bound by default to 'F'
(uppercase F, that is, shift+f).
