Subject: Trash folder patch and whitespaces in folder names ...
Message-ID: <4406D50C.9000207@myunix.dk>

Hi Folks.

I have a problem using some IMAP folders with the trash folder patch.

Some of my IMAP mailboxes include whitespaces (eg. "Deleted Item, Junk 
Mail, etc)" and that works like a charm when browsing / accessing those 
folder via muttng - but when trying to get the trash folder patch to 
store mails in "Deleted Items" it seems to strip whitespaces from folder 
names ...

I am currently using revision 790.

Any ideas on how to solve this ?


Best Regards,

Henrik Johansen.

Do you really need fcc-hook or is $record okay?

With $record you can use:

   folder-hook . 'set record="$muttng_folder_path"'

$muttng_folder_path is a read-only variable that always contains the 
full path of the currently opened folder.

With fcc-hook you'd have to clear all previous fcc-hooks when entering a 
folder... which doesn't work as the unhook command cannot be used in 
other hooks.

   bye, Rocco

muttng-20060315 fixed it, though it still announces itself as
"Mutt-ng devel-r790 (based on Mutt 1.5.11/2005-09-15)"

The "no sleep problem unless $timeout > $sleeptime" I described in

You can install those files locally, so this is not a bug. For example
under Debian you need to install the docbook-xsl packages to get it
working with the -nonet option.

But maybe it would be useful to make the -nonet a ./configure-option?

Subject: weird characters in "from" field in the index
Message-ID: <20060321162545.GA1212@werner>

Hello,

I have encountered the following weird behavior when using mutt-ng to 
browse newsgroups.

On one particular newsgroup, the "from" field in the index is padded 
with ?? instead of spaces. So there are alternating A-tilde and question 
marks.

Not all messages have this cosmetic problem. Also, when I open an 
affected post in the pager, the "from" field in the index shows the name 
of the poster, padded with spaces (the expected behavior).

There are no accented characters in the posters names (so this rules out 
a broken news client at the posters side).

The IMO relevant settings from my muttngrc are:
	set charset="utf-8"
	muttngrc.display:set index_format="%4C %Z %4N %{%F %R} %2X %-20.20F (%?l?%4l&%4c?) %s"

I start muttng in a rxvt-unicode, so displaying utf-8 characters 
shouldn't be any problem.

I haven't been able to reproduce this behaviour when listing the 
contents of either normal mailfolders or other newsgroups (the behavior 
shows in just one particular newsgroup).

If you want me to put up a screenshot somewhere, or need more 
information or config options, I'll be happy to provide them.

Is this a bug in muttng or just some setting I have wrong?

Greets,
Sven

Subject: ANSI colors in pager misbehave?
Message-ID: <20060322005140.GA29157@werner>

Hello,

I have "set allow_ansi" and "set implicit_autoview" in my muttrc file. I 
wanted to use the code2color script from 
http://www-zeuthen.desy.de/~friebel/unix/less/code2color to 
automatically display source code attachments (C(++), perl, ...) in 
color, but it seems muttng doesn't display the colors like it should.

It's hard to explain what exactly goes wrong (and even harder to make an 
educated guess where in the source code things go wrong). Maybe the best 
way is to see for yourself. Download the script and invoke it with 
"code2color <sourcefile>" to see what it should do.
Then put a line in your mailcap to filter source code (there doesn't 
seem to be a unique mime-type for source files, I've encountered quite 
some on the mailing lists I'm subscribed to), mail yourself the source 
file and view it in the internal pager.

Also try to scroll the code2color'ed output in the pager, the colored 
bits all change color (which shouldn't happen).

I use muttng-r781.

Greets,
Sven

It seems that the from-names in the messages are padded with a \240 
(hex. A0) character. According to iso_8859-1(7), this is a no-break 
space.

Most users on that newsgroup use some web-frontend to post messages, so 
that's the likely culprit for this unexpected character.

Still it would seem to me that muttng should be able to cope with this. 
As mentioned before, when I open a message sent by someone with an 
affected realname, the pager all of a sudden displays the correct name 
(properly padded with spaces).

Any insights on this issue?

Greets,
Sven

Even more sorry for this reply to a reply...

It seems the index shows this behavior with both from- and subject 
fields.
When an accented character (or anything with ASCII-code above 127, for 
that matter) is present in a field that is displayed in the index, 
everything in that field, starting from the non-us-ascii character to 
the end of the field is not displayed and a series of alternating 
A-tilde and question marks are displayed instead.

When such a message is opened in the pager, the index gets updated to 
the expected output.

When trying to duplicate this behavior, i sent myself a mail with "t?st" 
in the subject. Muttng changed this to '=?iso-8859-1?Q?t=E9st?=' as it 
should, so this seems to be the result of broken mailers/newsclients not 
making the correct substitutions for header values outside of the 
us-ascii character range.

Can this be fixed?

Thanks in advance,
Sven

Segfaults are always a bug. Can you provide a backtrace?

I've attached a newsgroup post that has a defective From: header. I've 
gzipped it to make sure muttng doesn't mangle (repair) the defective 
header to a properly encoded one.

The From: line contains a non-ASCII character (hex 0xA0, dec 160) which 
is standard-violating. I googled for a latin1 map and it says this is 
"non breaking space".

Here muttng simply displays an additional space character in a latin1 
terminal but garbage in UTF-8 terminal. If no encoding information is 
given, muttng simply prints everything as-is and doesn't do guessing at 
all.

I have no exact idea on how to solve this besides telling the poster 
that it's illegal and he should go look for a more standard compliant 
news client.

We've already had some issues with it and whatever we do, it'll always 
be wrong. With -nonet one would be abled to correctly build the docs if 
the DocBook stylesheets aren't installed locally.

When they're locally installed, no network access should be required. If 
not and there's no network, it doesn't make sense to build the 
documentation at all. In this case we could skip the complete build 
process for docs instead of puting -nonet in.

So I'm still not sure on how to exactly proceed... :(

Muttngs doesn't behave consequently on my UTF-8 terminal. It prints 
garbage in the index when the message hasn't been viewed in the pager 
yet, but when the message is opened in the pager, the index is updated 
and displays as expected.

>I have no exact idea on how to solve this besides telling the poster that it's illegal 
>and he should go look for a more standard compliant news client.

It's a newsgroup where the majority of posters use a web frontend (and 
that frontend seems to add the 0xA0 character). I don't think the users 
want to change their news"client", but I'll ask the maintainer of the 
website to make his backend standards compliant.

I haven't been able to figure out why muttng changes from garbled output 
to expected output when opening the message in the pager. It seems 
muttng knows how to display the index line (as shown when it's opened in 
the pager).
Does muttng use two different formatting routines for displaying entries 
in the index (one when the pager is not opened, the other when it is 
opened)?

Greets,
Sven

I only saw this with NNTP and the same cache being used with different 
character sets. Before caching it (note: the NNTP cache is _not_ the 
header cache for Maildir/IMAP), it gets decoded and is stored, say in 
latin1. When loading it from the index with charset==utf-8, it's assumed 
that it's decoded properly which isn't the case. When in the pager, it 
gets decoded/converted again but this time to the right character set. 
Thus the index is correct afterwards. This is a known bug.

Okay. I don't really see a reason to add the character at all; but if it 
get's added, it needs to be encoded (but that still could make the above 
mentioned bug occur).

Is there a known workaround too? ;)

I have the following charset related options in my muttngrc, but I don't 
think any of these control the charset the NNTP cache is stored in:
	set config_charset="utf-8"
	set charset="utf-8"
	set assumed_charset="us-ascii:iso-8859-15:utf-8"
	set send_charset="us-ascii:iso-8859-15:utf-8"
	set file_charset=""

> Okay. I don't really see a reason to add the character at all; but if it get's added, it

Me neither. But bugs happen and maybe all quality assurance the 
developer did was to check if his posts looked good in Outlook Express.

Greets,
Sven

I am on a few mailing lists that are rather high volume. Currently,
those mailboxes have folder-hooks limiting the view to ~N, which works
OK. However, I'd prefer to get a bit more context. Is there a way (and
if so, how?) to, in threaded mode, display the full threads which
contain new messages, while not displaying or at least collapsing the
rest?

Looking at the documentation did not turn up anything obvious, but any
pointers to anything !NULL are appreciated.

Just do it manually once, create a macro and put it into a folder-hook:

   1) uncollapse all
   2) untag all
   3) tag all new
   4) collapse all
   5) tag-exec: uncollapse thread

It works manually so it can be automated. :-)

Still it's not really good for larger threads.

No. You could try to not have a cache for nntp ($nntp_cache_dir) but 
that increases network load. (at least here no cache seems to be faster 
than cache with a news server in my LAN, hmm...).

>I have the following charset related options in my muttngrc,

>cache is stored in:

$charset determines the encoding for the NNTP cache. But this only 
matters if the cache is used with muttng of different $charset settings.

You could still try to remove the cache and start over again. If the 
problem remains, it's something different.

Definitely better than what I had before though, thanks for the
suggestion. For the benefit of the archives, here is what I came up
with (a really long line):

folder-hook =mailbox 'push "<untag-pattern>~A<enter><tag-pattern>~N<enter><collapse-all><tag-prefix><collapse-thread><untag-pattern>~A<enter>"'

It appears that <collapse-{thread,all}> are simply toggle functions,
so there is no explicit uncollapse counterpart. However, since my
configuration at least has everything expanded when the mailbox is
opened, this is a close enough approximation.

I just tried the very same. The problem is that <collapse-thread> works 
with the current thread only and is not really considered for all tagged 
messages. Read: it un-collapses the first thread with new mail.

Just mark two messages in different threads as new. We really need a 
scripting language to have loops for things like that... ;-)

Yes, that what the help screen says, too. :-)

Neither of these work. I still get garbled entries in the index when I 
open that particular newsgroup.

According to the manual, $charset determines "[the] Character set your 
terminal uses to display and enter textual data." (it doesn't mention 
the NNTP cache).
I guess it doesn't make sense to set $charset to something like 
"us-ascii:iso-8859-15:utf-8"?

Since I don't run a local newsserver and thus am unable to sanitize the 
messages before muttng can get to them, it seems my only hope is to 
convince the web-frontend developer to make his posting engine standards 
compliant.

Thank you for your suggestions anyway.
Sven

    Such value can't work correctly. I'd suggest better for westerners
$assumed_charset=cp1252. This might even solve the unencoded no-break
space in header problem, I hope. Also if you have a $strict_mime
variable in Muttng, it would have to be unset.

Done. I've tried to put every option in my config files, I've commented 
it out. If it's derived from my locale, it should be set to utf-8 
anyway.

$strict_mime was already unset (to make $assumed_charset valid).

If I set $assumed_charset to cp1252, I don't get the ?? padding anymore, 
but the from field gets padded with "??????????????????". This is even 
more unexpected behavior...

Unsetting $assumed_charset doesn't entirely work either, but it gives a 
better result. It puts a transparent rectangle (?) in place of the 
no-break space or accented characters in the from field and doesn't 
truncate the content (for example, "Dani?l" becomes "Dani?l" instead of 
"Dani<garbage>").

I'll look further into other values for $assumed_charset tomorrow, it's 
time for bed now ;)

Thank you for your suggestions,
Sven

Subject: muttng and courier imap -> no new-message count?
Message-ID: <5093.1143390100@www079.gmx.net>

hello,
i'm using muttng with a local courier-imap server.
I'm using the sidebar to have an overview of my folders, but the sidebar
counts only the total number of messages:

INBOX          200
INBOX/foo    140
....

and not the number of unread messages as i would expect it.
Does someone know the problem? Does i need a special config-option so that
the sidebar count the new messages too?

My muttng imap config (~/.muttngrc):

[..]
set folder= imap://user at 127.0.0.1/
set imap_pass="XXX"
mailboxes +INBOX \
          +INBOX/foo \
          +INBOX/Sent\ Items \
          +INBOX/Junk\ Mail \
          +INBOX/Drafts \

Current workaround:

don't set assumed_charset in the config file (or unset it)

message-hook . "unset assumed_charset"
message-hook "~h X-Newsreader:\ Microsoft\ Outlook\ Express" "set assumed_charset='cp1252'"

This second message-hook is necessary for messages sent with MSOE. If 
it's not present, accented characters show up as question marks in the 
body of messages.

Non us-ascii characters in the headers show up as transparent rectangles 
in the index (I tried a few values for $assumed_charset, but simply 
unsetting that variable gives the most acceptable results for the index).

When school is out and this is still not fixed, I'll look into it and 
I'll try to write a patch. But this won't happen until July.

Sven

Subject: hook for NNTP?
Message-ID: <20060329091743.GA2530@werner>

Hello,

I was wondering if it's possible to set hooks for when posting no 
usenet.

For example, if I send mail, I want my from-address to be my normal 
address. If I post to usenet on the other hand, I'd rather have my from 
address to end in .invalid and set a Reply-To: header with my correct 
address.

I tried:
	send-hook "~h Newsgroups:" "set from=sven at tuxera.invalid"

but muttng tells me that kind of expression is invalid in that context. 
When checking the man page afterwards, it seems muttng is right ;)

I'm out of ideas on how to hook usenet postings and googling didn't turn 
up anything.

Can someone tell me if it's possible? And if it's possible, how I can do 
it?

Thanks,
Sven

You can try to use the ~w pattern like this:

   send-hook ~w. "set ..."

The ~w pattern matches against the Newsgroups: header.

If that doesn't work, you can still use a folder-hook:

   folder-hook ^nntp: "..."

though it wouldn't work in situations where you want to post to a 
different group than current (or from a mailbox).

This work...

folder-hook nntp 'push l~N\n'

...or this...

send-hook !~t. 'set record=+posted'

...or (the best of all) the tipps in Roccos mail. ;-)

    Wow! I assume this garbage is still in index, from cache, while
opening the message redisplays a correct non-break space, right? In fact
this begins to look vaguely as double transcoding:

| $ printf "\xC3\x83\xC2\xA0" | iconv -f cp1252 -t utf-8 | iconv -f cp1252 -t utf-8
| ??????????????????

    Well even triple transcoding, as the cache already contains UTF-8
from the beginning, IIUC. I don't understand exactly what happens, but
the nntp cache doesn't seem to cooperate well with $assumed_charset.

    With $assumed_charset unset, an 8-bit byte is not transcoded, but
displayed as-is in "pass-thru" mode. It is only masked by "?" or U+FFFD
(replacement char) if it is invalid (as is this A0 in an UTF-8 locale).
Not nice unless the raw message's charset matches the current locale.

    That seems the less bad compromise I can imagine so far, right. OTOS
it might perturbate replying (exactly the "To:" prompt) I think.

    Note many other mailers, webmails, and newsreaders would need it
also. MSOE users can be hinted to set: MIME, encoding none, and uncheck
"allow 8 bits chars in header" in Tools -> Options -> Sending -> News ->
Plain text parameters.

I'd like to use this to score down cross-posted posts.

I've been trying lines like
score "~w '.*,.*,.*'" -1
hoping that it will match the commas between the newsgroups. But it
doesn't seem to work.

Am I doing something stupid, or does ~w just apply to each newsgroup
individually?

I've tried Googling, but searching for "~w" isn't that easy...

I'm on "Mutt-ng devel-r790 (based on Mutt 1.5.11/2005-09-15)" on FC5,
compiled for AMD64.

Thanks,

James.
