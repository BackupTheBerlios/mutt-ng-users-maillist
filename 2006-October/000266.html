<PRE>Hello everybody,

As some of you may have noticed, mutt-ng development came to a halt
quite a while ago. The problem was that mutt-ng, in its original form,
wasn't really maintainable anymore. We had huge issues merging changes
that happened in mutt, as well as newer versions of the patches that we
had integrated into mutt-ng. This led to a total lack of motivation to
push mutt-ng development forward, and eventually all efforts were
suspended.

Recently, I collected my thoughts about what could have been done better
in the whole development, and my conclusion was that a fork can't
survive without a certain user community, and the mutt-ng community
never really got that big. Another big issue was the lack of the right
tools, or at least the knowledge about them, e.g. we had absolutely no
patch management.

The consequence of all that was that I decided to &quot;restart&quot; the whole
project, but with different goals. The new mutt-ng isn't supposed to be
a fork anymore, but instead a well-integrated set of patches against the
latest version of mutt. I experimented a little bit with different patch
management tools, and decided to use &lt;a
href=&quot;<A HREF="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt/">http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt/</A>&quot;&gt;quilt&lt;/a&gt; in
combination with a Subversion repository. For those who don't know
quilt: it manages a stack of patches, and you can push and pop them. The
patches themselves are stored in a subdirectory called &quot;patches&quot;. When
you're a certain patch, you can edit some files, and then refresh the
patch so that your changes are reflected in the corresponding patch
file. To change a patch to a newer version, all you need to do is to pop
as far as the patch before the patch to be replaced, copy the new patch
over the old patch, and push it. If there are any conflicts, force the
push, correct the conflicts, and refresh the patch. Then push the rest
of the patches, which usually works with no or little extra work. This
means that managing a relatively big set of patches is quite simple,
while quilt manages all the &quot;dirty&quot; stuff.

So far, I managed to reintegrate most of the patches we had in mutt-ng,
and also to port some of the mutt-ng-specific features and bugfixes. The
new mutt-ng isn't as complete as the old one, but its pretty usable, and
the most important things like sidebar and NNTP support work already. If
you want to have a look at the current state, read &lt;a
href=&quot;<A HREF="http://bereshit.synflood.at/svn/mutt-patches/trunk/README">http://bereshit.synflood.at/svn/mutt-patches/trunk/README</A>&quot;&gt;this
description&lt;/a&gt; on how to apply these patches. As stated above, you will
need quilt in order to use it.

Feedback is welcome, and I would also like to know if this new
development model is desired and accepted by the community.

Regards,
Andreas Krennmair
