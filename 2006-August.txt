Subject: new user - bugs?
Message-ID: <20060823082320@troy.piggo.com>

Hi - I'm a very new mutt-ng user, from a long time mutt and slrn
user background.

I have some things I've noticed since installing mutt-ng on the
weekend that don't seem correct, but please forgive me if posting
bugs etc to this list is frowned upon.  Just let me know.

Man pages - there is no entry for the 'score' command.  There is
for the 'score' boolean variable, but not for the command to
assign scores.

Man pages - there is no mention of 'error' as a valid object for
'color' command.

New mail notification - my mailboxes are mbox format.  In browser
view ones with new mail are flagged 'N' like they were in mutt.
However if I enter one of those mailboxes, read some of the new
mail but not all, then go back to the browser window that same
mailbox is still flagged 'N'.  In mutt even if you didn't read
any of the new mail, once you left the mailbox they were marked
as old and the 'N' disappeared from flag.

my_hdr - I have hooks for creating my own unique message id's
depending on whether I am sending mail or posting news.  I've
found mutt-ng inserting extra spaces between the header name and
the header content.  More detailed explanation:

send-hook . 'my_hdr Message-ID: <`date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S"`@troy.piggo.com>'
send-hook '~f usenet-[0-9]{4}@piggo.com' 'my_hdr Message-ID: <`date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S"`@usenet.piggo.com>'
folder-hook . 'set from=troy at piggo.com'
folder-hook .*[.]+.* 'set from=usenet-`date +"%y%m"`@piggo.com'

The message id's are of the format 200608230830 at troy.piggo.com
Note in the above hooks the single space between Message-ID: and
the <...

If I just create a new mail by hitting 'm', entering the To:
header, entering the Subject: header, then mutt-ng takes me into
vim to type the message body, I then save and exit vim, then hit
send from the menu by hitting 'y', the mail gets sent but the
message-id has /two/ spaces between 
Message-ID:  200608230830 at troy.piggo.com
           ^^

If I do the exact same as the above, but instead of hitting 'y'
to send the mail I hit 'E' to edit the headers and message, this
takes me back into vim, if I don't even edit the message but just
save it again and then hit 'y' to send it, the message-id somehow
only has the correct single space in it.

To try to rectify this I changed the hook to contain no spaces:

send-hook . 'my_hdr Message-ID:<`date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S"`@troy.piggo.com>'

and in both of the above described methods of sending normally
versus re-editing with headers the message-id has only one space.
So that solves my immediate problem but I would have thought the
hook should contain the single space.
