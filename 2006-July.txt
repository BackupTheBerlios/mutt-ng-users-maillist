Is muttng, as of today, vulnerable to the buffer overflow reported
recently?

Hi-

Wondering when we would be seeing some new builds?  Seems we've been on
r804 for quite a while now.

Thanks, and keep up the great work!

Sorry for my long absence... was moving my house.

I am already using this option but the sidebar does still only
display "new" messages.

The problem is that i am using muttng from one client, offlineimap
with maildir and muttng locally on another one. When i syncronize my
messages with offlineimap on the notebook, i do not get the correct
number of unread messages in the sidebar when connecting to the imap
mailbox with my desktop pc (muttng directly, without offlineimap).
Wouldn't it be useful to have an option to configure the sidebar to
not only show "new" messages but also scan for "unread" messages in
all mailboxes so that it works fine also when the "new" flag is not
anymore on the message because another client (in this case
offlineimap) has already fetched the message.

Please tell me your opinions to file a feature-request.
