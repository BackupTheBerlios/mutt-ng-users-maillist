Subject: Forcing new IMAP mail detection in Mailboxes list?
Message-ID: <loom.20060201T152838-820@post.gmane.org>

When viewing the Mailboxes list, I'd like to be able to press a key
and cause mutt-ng to query my IMAP server and update the new message
count, in case new email has arrived since the last time I checked.

The imap-fetch-mail function doesn't work in browser mode.  Furthermore,
when I do the following, it still doesn't cause the new message count to
be updated:

  macro browser g "q<imap-fetch-mail><change-folder>?^I"

All that happens when I press "g" is for the folder to redisplay with the
same count of new messages that it had before, even if new emails have
arrived.

How can I get the new message count to be updated on demand when I'm in the
Mailboxes list?

Thanks in advance.

Hi there!

I'm new to muttng, though not to mutt, and would like to know how to
keep track of changes to the snapshot tarballs (not svn, that is). Is
there an RSS feed or the like? Is mutt-ng still under active
development at all?

Subject: Having outbound sent mail NOT marked as new
Message-ID: <20060208193731.GA11011@radio.m-a-g.net>

For some reason my outband sent mail in the $record folder is always marked
as new.  If this is normal, it seems rather strange to me.  What is the
proper way to not have it marked as such?  I am using Maildir.

Having sent this inquiry recently to the mutt-users list, I received a reply
of:

Blame mutt-ng then. Plain mutt does not do that.

----- End forwarded message -----

Could this really be specific to Mutt-ng?  But more importantly, for me 
at least, does anyone have any idea how I can fix this problem?

Thanks in advanced to whomever might have the time to help.

My recorded mail isn't marked as new. I can't find anything in muttng's
manpages to suggest it's possible to do what you apparently are doing ;)

Actually, I am seeing the same behaviour as Arias does, both with a rather
ancient version of muttng (about last July, I guess) and a version from
about 6 weeks ago. I am using LDAP.

Hmm, I get different results with mbox (both compressed and not) as well 
as Maildir and can't remember this ever being different so far.

I'm sorry for the long delay the last weeks, and I'm even more sorry 
that I have to delay this until next week...

The <buffy-list> function lists folders with new mail and is bound to 
'.' by default. With the $force_buffy_check option set, it first polls 
all folders for new mail before displaying the result. Perhaps this 
helps?

Sorry but no. There's not much logic behind the snapshots as they're 
simply archives from the latest devel tree (and not only produced when a 
change happened). A very poor man's version could be to go by file size.

When changes are made, a mail listing the changes is sent to the 
developer's list but determing whether something changed within a week 
or so requires manual interaction and changelog reading.

Or you could try the subversion interface at our berlios site.

>Is mutt-ng still under active

In theory yes. The problem is that Andreas is at the army right now and 
doesn't have time at all. Nico is busy with university. I'm busy with 
other projects and have been ill for a few weeks so that there wasn't 
much progress...

No there isn't. But you have control over which headers are shown so you 
could only let it provide non-empty fields and add new headers manually 
as needed. This isn't really elegant, but it could do...

Or you could try:

and

   <http://mutt-ng.berlios.de/Changelog.rewrite>

which now still are empty as subversion is terribly slow at the moment.

As the space to empty header fields is always added regardless of 
$edit_headers, my suggestion to simply remove the space in all cases. 
IMHO special treatment for format=flowed only doesn't make sense.

I'll go ahead removing it for all cases... except someone comes up with 
a really good point for why the space is important. Opinions?

I'm not familiar with this system; they show different version
numbers (774/trunk vs 776/rewrite)?

That's ok. There's only one number for the whole project. 774/trunk says 
that the "normal" or "old" version was last changed in revision 774 
while the rewrite was last changed in revision 776.

Subject: sidebar_width is executed even with sidebar invisible
Message-ID: <20060209120306.GB6849@hermes.commontology.de>

Hello list,
During review of my muttngrc ($editor_headers) I have discovered that I 
when I <:set sidebar_width=xy>, while the sidebar is /not/ visible, I 
get a somwhat garbled display: I have xy chars to the left of the window 
/without the actual sidebar in it/. It seems the regular contents of the 
main window is shifted xy chars to the right and whatever falls out on 
the right window border is wrapped around and shows in this peculiar 
"would-be" sidebar area.

Shall I first try to get a newer version from CVS and then confirm it is 
still the same?

Cheers,
Andreas

Now I'm confused -- what IS the latest version of mutt-ng? Are .trunk
and .rewrite ever in sync? I'm planning to write a script that will
download either .trunk or .rewrite and check the version against the
version installed on my system, then build muttng from the tarball.
Right now, today's tarball's version and the one found in .trunk do
match (744). Can I rely on that in the future?

Nope, these are totally different. The version in trunk/ is usable and 
what everybody else uses. In branches/ the only thing is the rewrite: an 
attempt to completely rewrite all of it. It's a completely different 
program that eventually feel the same as the "old" one now.

Just go with trunk.

It will be the same. By some accidentally mistyping I got the same 
effect. I (or one of the other three as they have time) will fix this 
soon (I could do it this weekend, hopefully)

I always use the most recent experimental version, although I recompile
it to include libesmtp, inodesort, flock, and ispell.  My user-agent 
header should reflect the same version as yours 2006-01-13.

It has happened to me too when I change the size of the font, but I cannot
reproduce it at the moment with the same version.

In r778 I tried to fix this by fixing the underlying problem and some 
more bugs triggered by this (for example, before r778, when the sidebar 
is hidden and one queries for $sidebar_width, muttng reports 0; when 
switching it back on it reported the correct value; now it should always 
report the correct one). I hope I caught all places but it may not be 
the case.

Please report back if the display looks strange and even if something

As said, I cannot reproduce this on several systems with compressed and 
uncompressed mbox and maildir.

I had a look at the code now. As far as I can tell, we didn't touch a 
single line so far in this area. Also, the calls are so obvious that I 
just can't imagine mail being marked as new.

That means I'm somewhat stuck.

The only way of getting more detailed information of what's going on 
seems to be to temporarily add some debugging code to see why this 
doesn't work for some users...

Is anybody willing of those affected to help?

This is done in r777. Btw, what vim settings do you use? I only get this 
problem when I let vim reformat the paragraph which I wouldn't do in the

After upgrading to r778 today, the display is now messed up.  By that,
I mean that paging down the lists of messages in the folder view, when
I reach the end if there is a gap on the screen after the last message,
the gap on the left is now filled with text from the previous screen
(message info from the previous screen).

I realize this is hard to picture by my description, so I will include
a screen capture if needed.

Thanks.

Sure, if you can give me some help on how to proceed. I just upgraded to
rev 781 (which, btw, has Bug #5970 fixed) which still shows this
behaviour. To describe this explicitly:

- I send a new email
- the count of mails in the sent folder, as shown in the sidebar, does
  change
- I execute imap-fetch-mail, the count of mails does not change, either
- I enter another folder using sidebar-open, now the count of both mails
  and unread mails in the send folder increase by one

Actually, I am seeing the same behaviour with the trash folder - mails
which are deleted and thus moved into that folder appear as unread
mails in the trash folder.

I forgot: If I then enter the sent folder, the mail is not marked as new
anymore and the count of unread mails in the sidebar changes to the
correct value.

Ditto with Wolf, I'd be happy to insert debug code, however the only difference in my behavior to his I should add
is going into the SENT folder alone does not in itself remove the N status flag from the just sent message.

I need to manually open the message to remove the N status, although i do have a macro set that auto opens
the first message of any mailbox that I enter so due to this mechanism the last just sent mail at the top of
my SENT folder shall auto open resulting in that N flag to unset.

This seems to be similar to Debian Bug#341369

can't reproduce even with the settings of the reporter.

Now I'm confused. Your problem description sounds like it's a sidebar 
issue. Is that right? I thought the problem was that the message itself in 
the sent/record/fcc folder is marked as new and not the count for it in 
the sidebar...

Hmm, what I forgot in the other mail: is this folder IMAP-based?

I'm on r781 now and I've only just played around with sidebar_visible 
and sidebar_width a bit and it is working perfectly AFAICT.

I'm on r781 now and it's fine now. I suppose the trouble comes from some 
of the vim settings I puzzled together from various places -- with only 
half understanding what they do. Anyway, since you've asked, here they 
are as far as mail is concerned, or better, since there is stuff for 
handling quotations, signatures, attachments, abook entries and more, as 
far as format=flowed is concerned.


in ftplugin/mail/mymail.vim:
----------------------------

set textwidth=72
set fo+=tcqwra
set updatetime=100

let MAIL_flowed = 0

function! s:flowed_context()
   if g:MAIL_flowed
     if (getline(line(".")) =~ "^-- $") || (getline(line((".")-1)) =~ "^-- $")
       set formatoptions-=aw
     else
       set formatoptions+=aw
     endif
   endif
endfunc

function! s:ft_mail()
   if &formatoptions =~# '\(w.*a\)\|\(a.*w\)'
     let g:MAIL_flowed = 1
   else
     let g:MAIL_flowed = 0
   endif
   augroup Mail
     au!
     au CursorHold * call <SID>flowed_context()
   augroup END
endfunc

function! Fixflowed()
    " save position
    let l = line(".")
    let c = col(".")
    normal G$
    " whiles are used to avoid nasty error messages
    " add spaces to the end of every line

       silent s/\([^]> :]\)\n\(>[> ]*[^> ]\)/\1 \r\2/g
    endwhile
    " now, fix the wockas spacing from the text
    while search('^\([> ]*>\)\([^> ]\)','w') > 0
       silent s/^\([> ]*>\)\([^> ]\)/\1 \2/

   " now, compress the wockas
    while search('^\(>>*\) \(>>*\( [^>]\)*\)', 'w') > 0
       silent s/^\(>>*\) \(>>*\( [^>]\)*\)/\1\2/
    endwhile
    " restore the original location, such as it is
    execute l . " normal " . c . "|"
endfunction

call s:ft_mail()
call Fixflowed()


---------------
I am not too sure where I have got this particular piece of vimcode 
from, surely somewhere from vim's tips archive. AFAIU, with "updatetime" 
it transparently reformats the paragraph while one is typing, which 
gives an automatic f=f linewrap when simply typing in a plain paragraph, 
but which also (e.g.) wraps the "Subject: " line onto the preceding "To: 
" line when that "To: " line ends with a space and when I am editing the 
Subject line. ... or rather /has/ wrapped, since without the trailing 
space it's much better now. (I believe the two functions I pasted above 
don't even have anything to do with the problem at hand, but I am not 
sure and you might be interested nonetheless (and they might help you to 
find the corresponding entry in the tips archive), so I pasted them 
anyway.

I hope that was what you've asked for,

See you,
Andreas

Thank you, but this doesn't update my Mailboxes list.  I double-checked,
and I do have the following statement in /usr/local/etc/Muttngrc:

  set force_buffy_check=yes

And yes, I have indeed properly built mutt-ng so that it looks for
Muttngrc in /usr/local/etc.  My other settings in that file do actually
take effect.

I also double-checked, and <buffy-list> is indeed bound to '.'.  However,
when I am viewing the Mailboxes list and I type '.', the new message count
doesn't change, despite the fact that there are definitely new messages in
the folder.

The only time I see this new-message count being updated for a given folder
is if I enter the folder, and then return to the Mailboxes list.  It seems
as if mutt-ng doesn't actually query the contents of any folders until I 
specifically enter them.

Recall that these are IMAP folders.  Does this make a difference?

Or is there some other configuration variable that I'm missing which needs
to be set before mutt-ng will actually query folders when I'm looking at
the Mailboxes list and invoke the <buffy-list> command?

Thanks again.

I'm sorry to say muttng 781 messes up the power management on my
iBook/Mac OS X 10.4.4. I had to compile plain mutt 1.5.11 w/
--enable-buffy-size for correct mbox update behavior; muttng shows
the correct behavior only if compiled w/o --enable-buffy-size. So far
so good. But a running muttng w/o it causes system insomnia, no
matter what $force_buffy_list is set to. Has anybody else come across
this? Is there a cure? I cannot stick with if there isn't.

Thanks,

I started with 778, that's all I can say to your second question. The
syptoms, well, I compiled like twenty different versions, and set the
iBook sleep to 1 minute. The results vary from my first statement:

Not allowing for sleep, but working perfectly otherwise:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-nntp --enable-compressed
  --enable-pop --enable-imap --with-ssl --with-gss
  --with-docdir=/usr/local/share/doc/mutt --sysconfdir=/usr/local/etc
  --enable-hcache --with-libesmtp=/usr/local 

Allowing for sleep:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-nntp --enable-compressed
  --enable-pop --enable-imap --with-ssl --with-gss
  --with-docdir=/usr/local/share/doc/mutt --sysconfdir=/usr/local/etc
  --enable-hcache --with-libesmtp=/usr/local --enable-buffy-size

The latter, used with "set force_buffy_check=yes", seems to work most
of the time. Particularly, there are problems when a mailbox receives
new mail, I switch to it and read all mail, then read news, and a
different mailbox receives mail. In this case, the first mailbox is
marked as containing new mail even though this isn't true -- which is
the typical problem --enable-buffy-size used to cure on upstream
mutt-dev. With "set force_buffy_check=no", it always show the
erroneous buffy behavior.

I'm evaluating a macro <sync-mailbox><change-newgroup> to see if that
makes a difference or not. But of course it would be working around
the problem.

This is an iBook G3 900 w/ Mac OS X 10.4.4 with HFS+/journaled and
FileVault here.

Subject: folder-hook . mailboxes not working
Message-ID: <20060214210121.GA24731@durance.shot.pl>

My ~/.procmailrc sorts mail based on the Delivered-To: and List-Id:
headers, creating new ~/Mail/lists/... maildirs on demand. The following
settings work on mutt-ng?s start:

mailboxes =unsure `echo /home/shot/Mail/lists/*`
lists `cd /home/shot/Mail/lists/; echo *`

I use mutt-ng in a screen on a remote server, though,
so I don?t restart it for days. What I?d like to have is

folder-hook . mailboxes =unsure `echo /home/shot/Mail/lists/*`

This is evalated once on mutt-ng start, but doesn?t seem to be
re-evaluated on folder changes. I?m using Debian?s 0.0+20060113-1
package (r774), rebuilt for Ubuntu Breezy.

It's something silly like needing to add quotes?

Unfortunately not; I did the above, restarted mutt-ng, `cp -pr`-ed
a maildir with new mail to a new name (under ~/Mail/lists), and
mutt-ng doesn?t pick it up as new on folder changes.

Of course. ;-)

The $set_buffy_check variable only has influence on the buffy-list 
function which can only be invoked manually.

And with revision 778 it went fine? Anybody else having problems with 
mbox and >778? I'll look into it...

<---snip--->

Okay, apparently this IS an IMAP related issue.  I found the problem
in the archives of the procmail mailing list.  Apparently this is
a known issue with imap not marking sent mail as read so it needs to
be unmarked new with procmail (assuming procmail is your solution
for sorting as it is mine) here is the thread and solution:

Does this work for you?

If so, I completely misunderstood the problem. When muttng (as well as 
mutt btw) store sent mail via $record/fcc-hook/etc., they store the mail 
directly to the destination folder. Read: it never gets inserted into 
any filtering chains such as procmail so tweaking procmail shouldn't 
have any effect if the problem was mutt(ng)-only. This procmail solution 
only works when someone's own mails come back via a mailing list so that 
procmail marks them as read (it could mark any other mail as read, not 
just the own).

The exception would be that someone uses cronjobs to pick up mails from 
local folders and inserting them into procmail to filter again (but I 
cannot imagine someone really does something similar).

So are we talking about "coming-back" mails not being marked as read or 
mails really stored via $record/fcc-hook not marked as read?

Ah, the '.' binding.

No, it never went fine for me on Mac OS X; I jumped in at v778. I was
surprised it compiled at all. Big improvement for PPC in comparison
to v2xx :)

If I can help in any way, let me know.

Yes, that's my point of view too. I have been having the problem you and I are
speaking about for some time (with mboxes), but now it seems it works properly.
I will post if I discover something new.

It is a workaround since it seem setting $record doesn't seem to do its job since it *should* insert my sent mail
into the specified folder that i'm setting record to.

Instead, it puts it in my inbox so I need to use the procmail filters to ensure that it goes to SENT.

If I unset record, there is no record at all of my sent mail anywhere.

Good, we're getting closer to the solution.

First of all, what status does the mail stored in your INBOX have? Is it 
new or marked read already?

Second, what are your values for the following variables: $record, 
$save_name and $force_name? The folder you name via $record (or the 
others mentioned plus fcc-hook) is shown as the 'Fcc:' pseudo header in 
the compose screen. What does it say?

Subject: Bug melden -- break-thread locks mailbox
Message-ID: <20060220091454.GA8496@hermes.commontology.de>

Hi list,
today I have had an issue with break-threads and mutt-ng told me to 
report a bug. I hope it is okay when I post to this list instead of 
embarking on a search for possible bugzilla ways of doing it (have never 
been there yet).

I have "unset strict_threads" and sort my mbox mailbox by thread. Today 
I've had two mails which got sorted into one thread due to their 
identical subject. (They had proper -- different from each other -- 
msgids.) When I did a <break-thread> on the second of them, it told me 
"thread broken" in the status line, but whenever I want to leave the 
mailbox for aother one or simply sync it, mutt-ng says "mailbox changed 
but messages not" and won't sync/change mailbox.

Need more details? (r781, mbox in my ext2fs home dir) ...or the headers 
of the messages in question?

I had this one time a few weeks ago but was to lazy to report it back 
then. Due to the occasion (2 messages with the same subject), it happens 
seldomly, but I think it is reproducible (just re-tried it).


Andreas

Hmm. What is the message exactly spelled? I couldn't find it in the 
source code nor similar variants (small/big letters)... ;-((

But I'll try to reproduce the problem.

On Thu, 16 Feb 2006, Rocco Rutte delivered in simple text monotype:

> First of all, what status does the mail stored in your INBOX have? Is it new or marked read already?
<---snip---
It's always marked as NEW.

> Second, what are your values for the following variables: $record, $save_name and $force_name? The folder you name

Verbatim from my muttngrc file:

  set record='+.SENT'
  unset save_name            
  unset force_name           

and no entry with anything matching fcc.

The result of muttng -t yields the absolute path of my SENT directory:

record="/home/ydef/Maildir/.SENT"

and the precise values I had set in my config file, which also happen to be the muttng defaults for these values: 

save_name=no
fcc_attach=yes
force_name=no

One more try to isolate the root of the problem: what happens if you 
increase $mail_check to a few minutes (btw, what is it set to now)?

I guess this has something to do with the sidebar and its counting 
routines (e.g. the machine can't go to sleep when the sidebar thinks it 
must count too often or does so even there's no need to)...

Aaah, it's a translated message. Now I at least see where the error is. 
IIRC there're reports about broken thread editing so I bet this is part 
of the problem. I'll see if I can track it down.

I'm not using the sidebar; set mail_check=60000 (from 5) doesn't
change anything. Is there an "easy" way to not apply the sidebar
patch but keep the others?

For mutt there's a sidebar patch we started off with but which 
completely changed (mostly fixes). To answer your question: no as it's 
included.

I found the culprit -- mutt-ng's $timeout must be greater than the
computer's sleep timeout. This is a mutt-ng specific issue.

In case you're confused now: The system *will* go to sleep if
mutt-ng's timeout is greater than the system's sleep timeout.

Don't know what you guys did, but it's back to the normal Mac OS X
sleep behavior w/ 786! THANKS!

Subject: ssl tls issues
Message-ID: <20060224131245.GB10927@radio.m-a-g.net>

I've been having issues with starttls with these types of errors:



[1:curs_lib.c:282:mutt_curses_error()] gnutls_handshake: A TLS fatal alert has been received.(Bad record MAC)


Which I'm not sure if its a result of my misconfiguration or the recent bug in libssl0.9.8 which has been
breaking all sorts of things.

Has anyone else noticed a problem when using tls?


Also, its unclear to me where muttng is looking for my private key.  The certificates_file and certificate_file
variables point to .crt files, and the only specific variable is my smime_default_key setting.

Am I to assume that its using my private key from the smime_default_key setting?

The error is reported by gnutls (i.e. the gnutls_handshake() function) 
and not OpenSSL.

>Has anyone else noticed a problem when using tls?

No.

It doesn't look for a private key since the error is reported prior to 
checking the certificate. I'm not a TLS/SSL guru but "handshake" looks 
like negotiation about connection details fail.

What server are you trying to connect to for what type of service? Since 
when do you get the error? Maybe the server admin changed something?

As gnutls is used for TLS1 and/or SSL3, maybe the server provides at 
most SSL2 so that no connection can be established?

<blush /> I had it accidentially compiled it w/ --enable-buffy-size;
so the problem persists, and the workaround still works around.

I'm trying to connect via nntps to the gmane secure nntp server at nttps://snews.gmane.org which is what I have my
$nntp_host variable set to.

I think gmane is pretty up to date.  Thing is, it used to work for me just fine.  Are you able to successfully connect
to them?

I'm not sure what you mean. I've always d'ld a fresh muttng-latest,
unpacked it, and compiled it using

  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-nntp --enable-compressed --enable-pop --enable-imap --with-ssl --with-gss --with-docdir=/usr/local/share/doc/mutt --sysconfdir=/usr/local/etc --enable-hcache --with-libesmtp=/usr/local 

(export CFLAGS=" -Os " in bash)

This is the first version with this problem since I'm in (r774-r781).

I get the "bad record mac" error with muttng using OpenSSL _and_ GnuTLS. 
Also, in the past we had a bug report that gmane doesn't support an NNTP 
extension other providers support for quite some years now.

So I guess this is a gmane issue. I don't have another SSL-enabled 
newsreader at hand to test this.

Using 'gnutls-cli-debug -p 563 snews.gmane.org' it prints that the 
server doesn't support SSL3 and TLS 1.0 as well as 1.1. This means that 
it doesn't work with GnuTLS (what you're trying).

With OpenSSL, there're many ssl_* variables. When using SSLv2 (v3 is not 
supported) I get another error 'bad mac decode' and 'bad mac record' 
with v3.

My conclusion: this is a gmane problem.

Can you contact any of its staff to have them debug it? Or can anyone 
connect to gmane via NNTPS with another newsreader?

   bye, Rocco

Hi,

we're currently have some trouble regarding status lines when the 
sidebar is enabled. The status line for the pager is treated specially 
since it's the only one always supposed to start next to the sidebar.

Personally I'd like to have consistent behavior. Either we always start 
next to the sidebar for all kinds of status lines or we start all of 
them at the very left of the screen.

I want to have all of them next to the sidebar.

Opinions?

Sorry for the noise, but I committed the update in r790 as one or the 
other may have seen already.

I tried to test under some circumstances but am sure I forgot some since 
there're so many variables ($status_on_top, $help, $pager_index_lines, 
etc.)

Please report back if everything looks like it's supposed to; if not, 
please include at least the values for the mentioned options...

Subject: Anyone using multiple accounts with mutt-ng?
Message-ID: <20060227141740.GA17068@chameleon>

I have another IMAP account that I'd like to read with mutt-ng.  But
from what I've been able to research, it appears that setting up
multiple accounts is a bit tricky.

Just curious if others are using mutt-ng with multiple accounts and, if
so, how difficult was it to set up?  Right now I read my main account
in mutt-ng and open other mailers to get to my other accounts.
Inefficient, so I'd like to change.

The help-line alway left margined will look perfect then;) It's like
reading a Dokument: Start reading a page at the left is the intuitiv
intention. Hmmm, same should be for the footer (info-line)
rigorously then?
