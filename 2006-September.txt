Hi folks,

first i must say that muttng is the best mailer of all, or like Sven
Guckes said: This one just sucks less :)

I have some problems displaying my muttng as you can see on the
following screenshots:

http://fibbs.dyndns.org/~chris/muttng_displayerror.png
http://fibbs.dyndns.org/~chris/muttng_displayerror2.png
http://fibbs.dyndns.org/~chris/muttng_displayerror3.png

As you can see, the message numbers get ugly when passing over a
message with the selection bar, the threading signs and the subjects
sometimes get scrambled and the display of the sidebar is sometimes
ugly, too.

I have noticed this problem using gnome-terminal, urxvt and xterm on
some different machines, all running gentoo linux and muttng-20060619. I
have also tested muttng on my ubuntu dapper box, self compiled because i
did not find actual binary debs for it and it seems that using the same
terminal (gnome-terminal from my Gentoo notebook via ssh) i do not have
the same problem.

Any ideas where to search for the problem?


Thanks

Christian Anton

This seems to be a $TERM problem. What tells
# echo $TERM
?

Does it look well sortet after hitting <ctrl> l?

different...

'gnome' on my notebook, 'xterm' from my windows box with putty,
'xterm' on my notebook, when i set it manually

>

Yes, it does.

The problems appear with all $TERM settings, but they seem to be
less with TERM='xterm'.
I will do further tests when i am at home next week, but if i remind
right, the problem does not appear when using the muttng that i
manually installed on the Ubuntu machine, using a ssh connection
from my notebook's gnome-terminal (TERM='gnome'), but appear when i
use the ubuntu's xterm or gnome-terminal and connect to my notebook
via ssh (TERM=xterm) and start the muttng there.

Might it be an issue with ncurses? 

Thanks for your help

Hello Christian,

    Suboptimal. Could be nicer with TERM=putty, or TERM=putty-256color
(for PuTTY 0.58). Unrelated with your problem, though.


> Might it be an issue with ncurses?

    Perhaps, yes: Do you use ncursesw with the "w"?

    What are your locale settings, your terminal charset ("translation"
in PuTTY), and ":set ?charset" in Muttng?

New mail notification - my mailboxes are mbox format.  In browser

Why is it behaving differently to mutt here?  How do I stop this?

You are lucky. In my case (using the debian package for amd64 in experimental)
mboxes with no new email are showing containing new mail.
I don't know C, so I cannot try to fix it by myself. But if anyone would try it,
I can help reporting more exact information.

I had this problem recently, but it turned out to be a badly
written procmail recipe - so I can only blame myself.

Have you had any mail that you were expecting not turn up?

My bad procmail recipe was just appending messages, without
headers, to the end of the mailbox.  So the mbox was getting an
updated modification timestamp, hence the new mail notification,
but when looked at it from within mutt/muttng you couldn't
see/read it.

According to "3.109. mark_old" of the
manual you have to set the mark_old
parameter:

$ echo "set mark_old" >> ~/.muttngrc

This is the default. So your customized
.muttngrc must include "unset mark_old" or
something similar.

No, my ~/.muttngrc has always contained this:

set mark_old=yes

When I leave a mbox that had new mail in it then re-enter that
mbox, the old but unread mail is correctly flagged as 'O'.  But
in the folder browser, and also when I hit '.' (buffy-list)
mailboxes with 'old' unread mail seem to be detected as 'new'.
This is not the case with plain mutt, which only notifies of
'new' unread mail.

Must be something else?

I just wanted to say I've got the same problem, on Mac OS X.
Compiling --enable-buffy-size doesn't change anything either.

The second time I visit the mailboxes, the flag seems to be gone. It
re-appears on all mailboxes that had new mail when new mail was
delivered to other mailboxes, until I visit them (the old ones)
again.

Thanks Andre.  Sorry, but I'm glad I'm not alone :-/

I can confirm that if I enter a mailbox that has "real" new mail
in it, even read it, then go to another mailbox, buffy-list shows
new mail in that mbox just read the new mail in.  If I enter that
mbox again there is no new mail there.  If I leave that mbox, the
buffy-list does not think it's new mail any more.
